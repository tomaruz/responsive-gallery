        <h3>A LITTLE MORE ABOUT THIS WEBSITE</h3>
        <p>As a designer, I enjoy looking at and dissecting other designers' work as it helps me understand the
            processes and reasoning behind their creative work. Here you will find a list of my favourite websites that
            I go for when I need some inspiration.<br><br>

            This website also contains a list of links to creative agencies' websites that I discovered, fell in love
            with and would like to work for in the future! I love going through their websites as they tend to document
            their design processes well and explain their creative thinking and solutions to tackle each brief.<br><br>

            I have also decided to create a gallery of design work that I found clever and inspiring. The constantly
            expanding gallery is a selection of my favourite design projects that I love!
